refactor out code types
	vendors
	clients
	employee
refactor to only create account if account_type is specified (so i can use the same account for different vendors/employees eg "cell phones" not "joe's cell (page plus) )

create vendors,clients,employees,invoices,etc

commissions as direct costs

create asset table that ties together:
	asset account
	accumlated deppreciation account
	depreciation expense account
OR
entry_assets
