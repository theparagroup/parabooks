--[step 2]

startup costs = ! fixed assets

asset depreciation/179 expense
invoice: subtotal, sales tax 

refactor out special columns from import lines in step1

	
--[STEP 3]
finish spreadsheet

refine by additional accounts:
	employees: advances, payroll, taxes, etc

--[STEP 4]
statements

--[STEP 5]
tax lines


--[later improvements]
seperate canonical and non-canonical account types

refactor out code types
	vendors
	clients
	employee
refactor to only create account if account_type is specified (so i can use the same account for different vendors/employees eg "cell phones" not "joe's cell (page plus) )

create vendors,clients,employees,invoices,payroll runs, etc

commissions as direct costs

depreciation, 179

create asset table that ties together:
	asset account
	accumlated deppreciation account
	depreciation expense account
OR
entry_assets

cash/accrual support (trans methods, ar accounts)

fix skip bug when generating nav properties (skip is not honored)

verify account canonical types needs to walk the hierarchy (denormalize in memory)
review transactors to use most appropriate set of canonicals

unaka credits


transactors:
	indicate allowed types via interface
	documentation/tax wiki integration

transaction definition specification? xml?
	inputs: account types, accounts, amounts
	operations: debits and credits
